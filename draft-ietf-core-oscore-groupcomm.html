  <h1 id="rfc.section.1">
<a href="#rfc.section.1">1.</a> <a href="#intro" id="intro">Introduction</a>
</h1>
<p id="rfc.section.1.p.1">The Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP) <a href="#RFC7252" class="xref">[RFC7252]</a> is a web transfer protocol specifically designed for constrained devices and networks <a href="#RFC7228" class="xref">[RFC7228]</a>.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.1.p.2">Group communication for CoAP <a href="#RFC7390" class="xref">[RFC7390]</a> addresses use cases where deployed devices benefit from a group communication model, for example to reduce latencies and improve performance. Use cases include lighting control, integrated building control, software and firmware updates, parameter and configuration updates, commissioning of constrained networks, and emergency multicast (see <a href="#sec-use-cases" class="xref">Appendix B</a>). Furthermore, <a href="#RFC7390" class="xref">[RFC7390]</a> recognizes the importance to introduce a secure mode for CoAP group communication. This specification defines such a mode.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.1.p.3">Object Security for Constrained RESTful Environments (OSCORE)<a href="#I-D.ietf-core-object-security" class="xref">[I-D.ietf-core-object-security]</a> describes a security protocol based on the exchange of protected CoAP messages. OSCORE builds on CBOR Object Signing and Encryption (COSE) <a href="#RFC8152" class="xref">[RFC8152]</a> and provides end-to-end encryption, integrity, and replay protection between a sending endpoint and a receiving endpoint possibly involving intermediary endpoints. To this end, a CoAP message is protected by including its payload (if any), certain options, and header fields in a COSE object, which finally replaces the authenticated and encrypted fields in the protected message.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.1.p.4">This document describes group OSCORE, providing end-to-end security of CoAP messages exchanged between members of a group. In particular, the described approach defines how OSCORE should be used in a group communication setting, so that end-to-end security is assured by using the same security method. That is, end-to-end security is assured for multicast CoAP requests sent by multicaster endpoints to the group and for related CoAP responses sent as reply by multiple listener endpoints. Group OSCORE provides source authentication of all CoAP messages exchanged within the group, by means of digital signatures produced through private keys of sender devices and embedded in the protected CoAP messages. As in OSCORE, it is still possible to simultaneously rely on DTLS to protect hop-by-hop communication between a multicaster endpoint and a proxy (and vice versa), and between a proxy and a listener endpoint (and vice versa).</p>
<h1 id="rfc.section.1.1">
<a href="#rfc.section.1.1">1.1.</a> <a href="#terminology" id="terminology">Terminology</a>
</h1>
<p id="rfc.section.1.1.p.1">The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP 14 <a href="#RFC2119" class="xref">[RFC2119]</a> <a href="#RFC8174" class="xref">[RFC8174]</a> when, and only when, they appear in all capitals, as shown here.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.1.1.p.2">Readers are expected to be familiar with the terms and concepts described in CoAP <a href="#RFC7252" class="xref">[RFC7252]</a> including "endpoint", "sender" and "recipient"; group communication for CoAP <a href="#RFC7390" class="xref">[RFC7390]</a>; COSE and counter signatures <a href="#RFC8152" class="xref">[RFC8152]</a>.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.1.1.p.3">Readers are also expected to be familiar with the terms and concepts for protection and processing of CoAP messages through OSCORE, such as "Security Context", "Master Secret" and "Master Salt", defined in <a href="#I-D.ietf-core-object-security" class="xref">[I-D.ietf-core-object-security]</a>.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.1.1.p.4">Terminology for constrained environments, such as "constrained device", "constrained-node network", is defined in <a href="#RFC7228" class="xref">[RFC7228]</a>.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.1.1.p.5">This document refers also to the following terminology.</p>
<p></p>

<ul>
<li>Keying material: data that is necessary to establish and maintain secure communication among endpoints. This includes, for instance, keys and IVs <a href="#RFC4949" class="xref">[RFC4949]</a>.</li>
<li>Group: a set of endpoints that share group keying material and parameters (Common Context of the group's Security Context, see <a href="#sec-context" class="xref">Section 2</a>). That is, the term group used in this specification refers to a "security group", not to be confused with network/multicast groups or application groups.</li>
<li>Group Manager (GM): entity responsible for a set of OSCORE groups. Each endpoint in a group securely communicates with the respective GM, which is not required to be an actual group member and to take part in the group communication. The full list of responsibilities of the Group Manager is provided in <a href="#sec-group-manager" class="xref">Section 6</a>.</li>
<li>Multicaster: member of a group that sends multicast CoAP request messages intended for all members of the group. In a 1-to-N communication model, only a single multicaster transmits data to the group; in an M-to-N communication model (where M and N do not necessarily have the same value), M group members are multicasters. According to <a href="#RFC7390" class="xref">[RFC7390]</a>, any possible proxy entity is supposed to know about the multicasters in the group and to not perform aggregation of response messages. Also, every multicaster expects and is able to handle multiple response messages associated to a given multicast request message that it has previously sent to the group.</li>
<li>Listener: member of a group that receives multicast CoAP request messages when listening to the multicast IP address associated to the group. A listener may reply back, by sending a response message to the multicaster which has sent the request message.</li>
<li>Pure listener: member of a group that is configured as listener and never replies back to multicasters after receiving request messages.</li>
<li>Group ID: group identifier assigned to the group. Group IDs are unique within the set of groups of a same Group Manager.</li>
<li>Endpoint ID: Sender ID of the endpoint, as defined in <a href="#I-D.ietf-core-object-security" class="xref">[I-D.ietf-core-object-security]</a>. An Endpoint ID is provided to an endpoint upon joining a group, is valid only within that group, and is unique within the same group. Endpoints which are configured only as pure listeners do not have an Endpoint ID.</li>
<li>Group request: multicast CoAP request message sent by a multicaster in the group to all listeners in the group through multicast IP, unless otherwise specified.</li>
<li>Source authentication: evidence that a received message in the group originated from a specifically identified group member. This also provides assurances that the message was not tampered with by a different group member or by a non-group member.</li>
</ul>

<a href="#rfc.section.2">2.</a> <a href="#sec-context" id="sec-context">OSCORE Security Context</a>
</h1>
<p id="rfc.section.2.p.1">To support group communication secured with OSCORE, each endpoint registered as member of a group maintains a Security Context as defined in Section 3 of <a href="#I-D.ietf-core-object-security" class="xref">[I-D.ietf-core-object-security]</a>. In particular, each endpoint in a group stores:</p>
<p></p>

<ol>
<li>one Common Context, shared by all the endpoints in the group. All the endpoints in the group agree on the same COSE AEAD algorithm. In addition to what is defined in Section 3 of <a href="#I-D.ietf-core-object-security" class="xref">[I-D.ietf-core-object-security]</a>, the Common Context includes the following information.  <ul>
<li>Group Identifier (Gid). Variable length byte string identifying the Security Context. A Gid MUST have a random component and be long enough, in order to achieve a negligible probability of collisions between Group Identifiers from different Group Managers. A Group ID is used i) alone or together with other parameters, such as the multicast IP address of the group, to retrieve the OSCORE Security Context of the associated group (see <a href="#mess-processing" class="xref">Section 4</a>); and ii) as OSCORE Master Salt (see Section 3.1 of <a href="#I-D.ietf-core-object-security" class="xref">[I-D.ietf-core-object-security]</a>). The choice of the Gid for a given group's Security Context is application specific. It is the role of the application to specify how to handle possible collisions. An example of specific formatting of the Group Identifier that would follow this specification is given in <a href="#gid-ex" class="xref">Appendix C</a>.</li>
<li>Counter Signature Algorithm. Value identifying the algorithm used for source authenticating messages sent within the group, by means of a counter signature (see Section 4.5 of <a href="#RFC8152" class="xref">[RFC8152]</a>). Its value is immutable once the Common Context is established. All the endpoints in the group agree on the same counter signature algorithm. The list of supported signature algorithms is part of the group communication policy and MUST include the EdDSA signature algorithm ed25519 <a href="#RFC8032" class="xref">[RFC8032]</a>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>one Sender Context, unless the endpoint is configured exclusively as pure listener. The Sender Context is used to secure outgoing group messages and is initialized according to Section 3 of <a href="#I-D.ietf-core-object-security" class="xref">[I-D.ietf-core-object-security]</a>, once the endpoint has joined the group. In practice, the symmetric keying material in the Sender Context of the sender endpoint is shared with all the recipient endpoints that have received group messages from that same sender endpoint. Besides, in addition to what is defined in <a href="#I-D.ietf-core-object-security" class="xref">[I-D.ietf-core-object-security]</a>, the Sender Context stores also the endpoint's public-private key pair.</li>
<li>one Recipient Context for each distinct endpoint from which group messages are received, used to process such incoming messages. The recipient endpoint creates a new Recipient Context upon receiving an incoming message from another endpoint in the group for the first time (see <a href="#ssec-verify-request" class="xref">Section 4.2</a> and <a href="#ssec-verify-response" class="xref">Section 4.4</a>). In practice, the symmetric keying material in a given Recipient Context of the recipient endpoint is shared with the associated sender endpoint from which group messages are received. Besides, in addition to what is defined in <a href="#I-D.ietf-core-object-security" class="xref">[I-D.ietf-core-object-security]</a>, each Recipient Context stores also the public key of the associated other endpoint from which group messages are received.</li>

<p id="rfc.section.2.1.p.2">Consistently with the security assumptions in <a href="#ssec-sec-assumptions" class="xref">Appendix A.1</a>, it is RECOMMENDED to adopt a group key management scheme, and securely distribute a new value for the Master Secret parameter of the group's Security Context, before a new joining endpoint is added to the group or after a currently present endpoint leaves the group.

</h1>
<p id="rfc.section.A.p.1">This section presents a set of assumptions and security objectives for the approach described in this document.</p>
<h1 id="rfc.appendix.A.1">
<a href="#rfc.appendix.A.1">A.1.</a> <a href="#ssec-sec-assumptions" id="ssec-sec-assumptions">Assumptions</a>
</h1>
<p id="rfc.section.A.1.p.1">The following assumptions are assumed to be already addressed and are out of the scope of this document.</p>
<p></p>

<ul>
<li>Multicast communication topology: this document considers both 1-to-N (one multicaster and multiple listeners) and M-to-N (multiple multicasters and multiple listeners) communication topologies. The 1-to-N communication topology is the simplest group communication scenario that would serve the needs of a typical low-power and lossy network (LLN). Examples of use cases that benefit from secure group communication are provided in <a href="#sec-use-cases" class="xref">Appendix B</a>.</li>
<li>Group size: security solutions for group communication should be able to adequately support different and possibly large groups. The group size is the current number of members in a group. In the use cases mentioned in this document, the number of multicasters (normally the controlling devices) is expected to be much smaller than the number of listeners (i.e. the controlled devices). A security solution for group communication that supports 1 to 50 multicasters would be able to properly cover the group sizes required for most use cases that are relevant for this document. The maximum group size is expected to be in the range of 2 to 100 devices. Groups larger than that should be divided into smaller independent groups, e.g. by grouping lights in a building on a per floor basis.</li>
<li>Communication with the Group Manager: an endpoint must use a secure dedicated channel when communicating with the Group Manager, even when not registered as group member. In particular, communications with the Group Manager occuring during the join process to become a group member must also be secured.</li>
<li>Establishment and management of Security Contexts: an OSCORE Security Context must be established among the group members. In particular, a Common Context must be provided to a new joining endpoint together with a corresponding Sender Context. On the other hand, Recipient Contexts are locally and individually derived by each group member. A secure mechanism must be used to generate, revoke and (re-)distribute keying material, multicast security policies and security parameters in the group. The actual establishment and management of the Security Context is out of the scope of this document, and it is anticipated that an activity in IETF dedicated to the design of a generic key management scheme will include this feature, preferably based on <a href="#RFC3740" class="xref">[RFC3740]</a><a href="#RFC4046" class="xref">[RFC4046]</a><a href="#RFC4535" class="xref">[RFC4535]</a>.</li>
<li>Multicast data security ciphersuite: all group members must agree on a ciphersuite to provide authenticity, integrity and confidentiality of messages in the group. The ciphersuite is specified as part of the Security Context.</li>
<li>Backward security: a new device joining the group should not have access to any old Security Contexts used before its joining. This ensures that a new group member is not able to decrypt confidential data sent before it has joined the group. The adopted key management scheme should ensure that the Security Context is updated to ensure backward confidentiality. The actual mechanism to update the Security Context and renew the group keying material upon a group member's joining has to be defined as part of the group key management scheme.</li>
<li>Forward security: entities that leave the group should not have access to any future Security Contexts or message exchanged within the group after their leaving. This ensures that a former group member is not able to decrypt confidential data sent within the group anymore. Also, it ensures that a former member is not able to send encrypted and/or integrity protected messages to the group anymore. The actual mechanism to update the Security Context and renew the group keying material upon a group member's leaving has to be defined as part of the group key management scheme.</li>

<h1 id="rfc.appendix.A.2">
<a href="#rfc.appendix.A.2">A.2.</a> <a href="#ssec-sec-objectives" id="ssec-sec-objectives">Security Objectives</a>
</h1>
<p id="rfc.section.A.2.p.1">The approach described in this document aims at fulfilling the following security objectives:</p>
<p></p>

<ul>
<li>Data replay protection: replayed group request messages or response messages must be detected.</li>
<li>Group-level data confidentiality: messages sent within the group shall be encrypted if privacy sensitive data is exchanged within the group. This document considers group-level data confidentiality since messages are encrypted at a group level, i.e. in such a way that they can be decrypted by any member of the group, but not by an external adversary or other external entities.</li>
<li>Source authentication: messages sent within the group shall be authenticated. That is, it is essential to ensure that a message is originated by a member of the group in the first place, and in particular by a specific member of the group.</li>
<li>Message integrity: messages sent within the group shall be integrity protected. That is, it is essential to ensure that a message has not been tampered with by an external adversary or other external entities which are not group members.</li>
<li>Message ordering: it must be possible to determine the ordering of messages coming from a single sender endpoint. In accordance with OSCORE <a href="#I-D.ietf-core-object-security" class="xref">[I-D.ietf-core-object-security]</a>, this results in providing relative freshness of group requests and absolute freshness of responses. It is not required to determine ordering of messages from different sender endpoints.</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="rfc.appendix.B">
<a href="#rfc.appendix.B">Appendix B.</a> <a href="#sec-use-cases" id="sec-use-cases">List of Use Cases</a>
</h1>
<p id="rfc.section.B.p.1">Group Communication for CoAP <a href="#RFC7390" class="xref">[RFC7390]</a> provides the necessary background for multicast-based CoAP communication, with particular reference to low-power and lossy networks (LLNs) and resource constrained environments. The interested reader is encouraged to first read <a href="#RFC7390" class="xref">[RFC7390]</a> to understand the non-security related details. This section discusses a number of use cases that benefit from secure group communication. Specific security requirements for these use cases are discussed in <a href="#sec-requirements" class="xref">Appendix A</a>.</p>
<p></p>

<ul>
<li>Lighting control: consider a building equipped with IP-connected lighting devices, switches, and border routers. The devices are organized into groups according to their physical location in the building. For instance, lighting devices and switches in a room or corridor can be configured as members of a single group. Switches are then used to control the lighting devices by sending on/off/dimming commands to all lighting devices in a group, while border routers connected to an IP network backbone (which is also multicast-enabled) can be used to interconnect routers in the building. Consequently, this would also enable logical groups to be formed even if devices in the lighting group may be physically in different subnets (e.g. on wired and wireless networks). Connectivity between lighting devices may be realized, for instance, by means of IPv6 and (border) routers supporting 6LoWPAN <a href="#RFC4944" class="xref">[RFC4944]</a><a href="#RFC6282" class="xref">[RFC6282]</a>. Group communication enables synchronous operation of a group of connected lights, ensuring that the light preset (e.g. dimming level or color) of a large group of luminaires are changed at the same perceived time. This is especially useful for providing a visual synchronicity of light effects to the user. As a practical guideline, events within a 200 ms interval are perceived as simultaneous by humans, which is necessary to ensure in many setups. Devices may reply back to the switches that issue on/off/dimming commands, in order to report about the execution of the requested operation (e.g. OK, failure, error) and their current operational status. In a typical lighting control scenario, a single switch is the only entity responsible for sending commands to a group of lighting devices. In more advanced lighting control use cases, a M-to-N communication topology would be required, for instance in case multiple sensors (presence or day-light) are responsible to trigger events to a group of lighting devices. Especially in professional lighting scenarios, the roles of multicaster and listener are configured by the lighting commissioner, and devices strictly follow those roles.</li>
<li>Integrated building control: enabling Building Automation and Control Systems (BACSs) to control multiple heating, ventilation and air-conditioning units to pre-defined presets. Controlled units can be organized into groups in order to reflect their physical position in the building, e.g. devices in the same room can be configured as members of a single group. As a practical guideline, events within intervals of seconds are typically acceptable. Controlled units are expected to possibly reply back to the BACS issuing control commands, in order to report about the execution of the requested operation (e.g. OK, failure, error) and their current operational status.</li>
<li>Software and firmware updates: software and firmware updates often comprise quite a large amount of data. This can overload a LLN that is otherwise typically used to deal with only small amounts of data, on an infrequent base. Rather than sending software and firmware updates as unicast messages to each individual device, multicasting such updated data to a larger group of devices at once displays a number of benefits. For instance, it can significantly reduce the network load and decrease the overall time latency for propagating this data to all devices. Even if the complete whole update process itself is secured, securing the individual messages is important, in case updates consist of relatively large amounts of data. In fact, checking individual received data piecemeal for tampering avoids that devices store large amounts of partially corrupted data and that they detect tampering hereof only after all data has been received. Devices receiving software and firmware updates are expected to possibly reply back, in order to provide a feedback about the execution of the update operation (e.g. OK, failure, error) and their current operational status.</li>
<li>Parameter and configuration update: by means of multicast communication, it is possible to update the settings of a group of similar devices, both simultaneously and efficiently. Possible parameters are related, for instance, to network load management or network access controls. Devices receiving parameter and configuration updates are expected to possibly reply back, to provide a feedback about the execution of the update operation (e.g. OK, failure, error) and their current operational status.</li>
<li>Commissioning of LLNs systems: a commissioning device is responsible for querying all devices in the local network or a selected subset of them, in order to discover their presence, and be aware of their capabilities, default configuration, and operating conditions. Queried devices displaying similarities in their capabilities and features, or sharing a common physical location can be configured as members of a single group. Queried devices are expected to reply back to the commissioning device, in order to notify their presence, and provide the requested information and their current operational status.</li>
<li>Emergency multicast: a particular emergency related information (e.g. natural disaster) is generated and multicast by an emergency notifier, and relayed to multiple devices. The latters may reply back to the emergency notifier, in order to provide their feedback and local information related to the ongoing emergency. This kind of setups should additionally rely on a fault tolerance multicast algorithm, such as MPL.</li>

<a href="#rfc.appendix.C">Appendix C.</a> <a href="#gid-ex" id="gid-ex">Example of Group Identifier Format</a>
</h1>
<p id="rfc.section.C.p.1">This section provides an example of how the Group Identifier (Gid) can be specifically formatted. That is, the Gid can be composed of two parts, namely a Group Prefix and a Group Epoch.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.C.p.2">The Group Prefix is uniquely defined in the set of all the groups associated to the same Group Manager. The choice of the Group Prefix for a given group's Security Context is application specific. A Group Prefix is random, constant over time,  and long enough to achieve a negligible probability of collisions between Group Identifiers from different Group Managers. The size of the Group Prefix directly impact on the maximum number of distinct groups under the same Group Manager.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.C.p.3">The Group Epoch is set to 0 upon the group's initialization, and is incremented by 1 upon completing each renewal of the Security Context and keying material in the group (see <a href="#sec-group-key-management" class="xref">Section 2.1</a>). In particular, once a new Master Secret has been distributed to the group, all the group members increment by 1 the Group Epoch in the Group Identifier of that group.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.C.p.4">As an example, a 3-byte Group Identifier can be composed of: i) a 1-byte Group Prefix '0xb1' interpreted as a raw byte string; and ii) a 2-byte Group Epoch interpreted as an unsigned integer ranging from 0 to 65535. Then, after having established the Security Common Context 61532 times in the group, its Group Identifier will assume value '0xb1f05c'.</p>

</h1>
<p id="rfc.section.D.p.1">An endpoint joins a group by explicitly interacting with the responsible Group Manager. Communications between a joining endpoint and the Group Manager rely on the CoAP protocol and must be secured. Specific details on how to secure communications between joining endpoints and a Group Manager are out of scope.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.D.p.2">In order to receive multicast messages sent to the group, a joining endpoint has to register with a network router device <a href="#RFC3376" class="xref">[RFC3376]</a><a href="#RFC3810" class="xref">[RFC3810]</a>, signaling its intent to receive packets sent to the multicast IP address of that group. As a particular case, the Group Manager can also act as such a network router device. Upon joining the group, endpoints are not required to know how many and what endpoints are active in the same group.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.D.p.3">Furthermore, in order to participate in the secure group communication, an endpoint needs to be properly initialized upon joining the group. In particular, the Group Manager provides keying material and parameters to a joining endpoint, which can then initialize its own Security Context (see <a href="#sec-context" class="xref">Section 2</a>).</p>
<p id="rfc.section.D.p.4">The following <a href="#join-process" class="xref">Appendix D.1</a> provides an example describing how such information can be provided to an endpoint upon joining a group through the responsible Group Manager. Then, <a href="#ssec-provisioning-of-public-keys" class="xref">Appendix D.2</a> discusses how public keys of group members can be handled and made available to group members. Finally, <a href="#join-ACE-framework" class="xref">Appendix D.3</a> overviews how the ACE framework for Authentication and Authorization in constrained environments <a href="#I-D.ietf-ace-oauth-authz" class="xref">[I-D.ietf-ace-oauth-authz]</a> can be possibly used to support such a join process.</p>

The exact content depends on whether the Group Manager is configured to store the public keys of group members. If this is the case, this information is omitted if it has been provided to the same Group Manager upon previously joining the same or a different group under its control. This information is also omitted if the joining endpoint is configured exclusively as pure listener for the joined group. <a href="#ssec-provisioning-of-public-keys" class="xref">Appendix D.2</a> discusses additional details on provisioning of public keys and other information to enforce source authentication of joining endpoints's messages.

<p id="rfc.section.E.2.p.2">A replay time interval exists, between when a possibly replayed message is originally transmitted by a given multicaster and the first authentic fresh message from that same multicaster is received.

<p id="rfc.section.E.3.p.1">A listener endpoint performs a challenge-response exchange with a multicaster, by using the Repeat Option for CoAP described in Section 2 of <a href="#I-D.ietf-core-echo-request-tag" class="xref">[I-D.ietf-core-echo-request-tag]</a>.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.E.3.p.2">That is, upon receiving a group request from a particular multicaster for the first time, the listener processes the message as described in <a href="#ssec-verify-request" class="xref">Section 4.2</a> of this specification, but, even if valid, does not deliver it to the application. Instead, the listener replies to the multicaster with a 4.03 Forbidden response message including a Repeat Option, and stores the option value included therein.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.E.3.p.3">Upon receiving a 4.03 Forbidden response that includes a Repeat Option and originates from a verified group member, a multicaster sends a request as a unicast message addressed to the same listener, echoing the Repeat Option value. In particular, the multicaster does not necessarily resend the same group request, but can instead send a more recent one, if the application permits it. This makes it possible for the multicaster to not retain previously sent group requests for full retransmission, unless the application explicitly requires otherwise. In either case, the multicaster uses the sequence number value currently stored in its own Sender Context. If the multicaster stores group requests for possible retransmission with the Repeat Option, it should not store a given request for longer than a pre-configured time interval. Note that the unicast request echoing the Repeat Option is correctly treated and processed as a group message, since the 'kid context' field including the Group Identifier of the OSCORE group is still present in the Object-Security Option as part of the COSE object (see <a href="#sec-cose-object" class="xref">Section 3</a>).</p>
<p id="rfc.section.E.3.p.4">Upon receiving the unicast request including the Repeat Option, the listener verifies that the option value equals the stored and previously sent value; otherwise, the request is silently discarded. Then, the listener verifies that the unicast request has been received within a pre-configured time interval, as described in <a href="#I-D.ietf-core-echo-request-tag" class="xref">[I-D.ietf-core-echo-request-tag]</a>. In such a case, the request is further processed and verified; otherwise, it is silently discarded. Finally, the listener updates the Recipient Context associated to that multicaster, by setting the Replay Window according to the Sequence Number from the unicast request conveying the Repeat Option. The listener either delivers the request to the application if it is an actual retransmission of the original one, or discards it otherwise. Mechanisms to signal whether the resent request is a full retransmission of the original one are out of the scope of this specification.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.E.3.p.5">In case it does not receive a valid unicast request including the Repeat Option within the configured time interval, the listener endpoint should perform the same challenge-response upon receiving the next multicast request from that same multicaster.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.E.3.p.6">A listener should not deliver group requests from a given multicaster to the application until one valid request from that same multicaster has been verified as fresh, as conveying an echoed Repeat Option <a href="#I-D.ietf-core-echo-request-tag" class="xref">[I-D.ietf-core-echo-request-tag]</a>. Also, a listener may perform the challenge-response described above at any time, if synchronization with sequence numbers of multicasters is (believed to be) lost, for instance after a device reboot. It is the role of the application to define under what circumstances sequence numbers lose synchronization. This can include a minimum gap between the sequence number of the latest accepted group request from a multicaster and the sequence number of a group request just received from the same multicaster. A multicaster has to be always ready to perform the challenge-response based on the Repeat Option in case a listener starts it.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.E.3.p.7">Note that endpoints configured as pure listeners are not able to perform the challenge-response described above, as they do not store a Sender Context to secure the 4.03 Forbidden response to the multicaster. Therefore, pure listeners should adopt alternative approaches to achieve and maintain synchronization with sequence numbers of multicasters.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.E.3.p.8">This approach provides an assurance of absolute message freshness. However, it can result in an impact on performance which is undesirable or unbearable, especially in large groups where many endpoints at the same time might join as new members or lose synchronization.</p>
<h1 id="rfc.appendix.F">
<a href="#rfc.appendix.F">Appendix F.</a> <a href="#sec-no-source-auth" id="sec-no-source-auth">No Verification of Signatures</a>
</h1>
<p id="rfc.section.F.p.1">There are some application scenarios using group communication that have particularly strict requirements. One example of this is the requirement of low message latency in non-emergency lighting applications <a href="#I-D.somaraju-ace-multicast" class="xref">[I-D.somaraju-ace-multicast]</a>. For those applications which have tight performance constraints and relaxed security requirements, it can be inconvenient for some endpoints to verify digital signatures in order to assert source authenticity of received group messages. In other cases, the signature verification can be deferred or only checked for specific actions. For instance, a command to turn a bulb on where the bulb is already on does not need the signature to be checked. In such situations, the counter signature needs to be included anyway as part of the group message, so that an endpoint that needs to validate the signature for any reason has the ability to do so.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.F.p.2">In this specification, it is NOT RECOMMENDED that endpoints do not verify the counter signature of received group messages. However, it is recognized that there may be situations where it is not always required. The consequence of not doing the signature validation is that security in the group is based only on the group-authenticity of the shared keying material used for encryption. That is, endpoints in the group have evidence that a received message has been originated by a group member, although not specifically identifiable in a secure way. This can violate a number of security requirements, as the compromise of any element in the group means that the attacker has the ability to control the entire group. Even worse, the group may not be limited in scope, and hence the same keying material might be used not only for light bulbs but for locks as well. Therefore, extreme care must be taken in situations where the security requirements are relaxed, so that deployment of the system will always be done safely.</p>
